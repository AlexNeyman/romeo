# Changelog

## v0.3.0

- Backwards incompatible changes
  - Removed `payload` key in favor of `xml` in the `Message`, `Presence`, and
    `IQ` stanzas. The full `xmlel` record is now stored in the `xml` key. This
    allows easy access via the functions in `Romeo.XML` module.
  - Messages generated with `Romeo.Stanza.message/3` no longer escape the body
    by default.

## v0.2.0

- Enhancements
  - [Romeo.JID] Added `user/1` which returns the `user` portion of the JID.
  - [Romeo.JID] Added `server/1` which returns the `server` portion of the JID.
  - [Romeo.JID] Added `resource/1` which returns the `resource` portion of the JID.
  - [Romeo.JID] Added key `full` JID struct for convenient access to the full
    JID.
  - [Romeo.Stanza] Added a clause to `to_xml/1` for `%Romeo.Stanza.Message{}`.
  - [Romeo.XML] Added a clause to `encode!/1` to handle all stanza structs.

- Backward incompatible changes
  - [Romeo.Connection] No longer sends stanza messages to the owner process
    until after the connection process has finished.
  - [Romeo.Connection] Stanzas sent to the owner process are now parsed into the
    matching stanza struct. The message tuple has changed from
    `{:stanza_received, stanza}` to `{:stanza, stanza}`.
